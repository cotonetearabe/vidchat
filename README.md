# VidChat

My experiment on creating a "zoom" clone, messages and vid chat powered by WebSockets, Firebase and WebRTC

## TODO:
- Reuse code from ChatApp and webrtc-chat
- Deal with encryption
- Maybe change database schema/storing chat history
- Keep more stuff in local storage
- If all the above are (at least somewhat) dealt with port to ReactNative or Electron for Desktop and Mobile experience
